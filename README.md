- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sindrei. I am currently working as a Geography and Information Technology teacher at Protea Heights Academy in South Africa. I am currently looking to expand the knowledge I already have and that I have lost to time and to build upon it. At the same time I hope to enjoy this fun and difficult journey with the hopes of maybe landing a tech job sometime in the foreseeable future.
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Software, Data and Geographic Information Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I am also interested in learning Python but one thing at a time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any problems I may struggle with or where I might be of assistance to other people.
- 📫 I am reachable at francoisdaniel.malan@gmail.com
